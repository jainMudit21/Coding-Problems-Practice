        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if(count == 0) {
                candidate = nums[i];

            count += (nums[i] == candidate) ? 1 : -1;

}

//the function assumes that majority element is present here. Very good algorithm (Boyer- moore Voting algo).
//Leetcode fucked the submissions of this one also. Apparently Sorting approach O(nlogn) is more fast than hashing O(n)
